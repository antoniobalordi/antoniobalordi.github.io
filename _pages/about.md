Hi!
I'm Antonio Balordi, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science. To be more precise, my doctoral research is in Strategic Sciences for Security and Defense under the supervision of Prof. Alessio Merlo (CASD).

My main research focus is Machine Unlearning, particularly how to ensure compliance with the Right to Be Forgotten as defined by the GDPR. Alongside this primary line of research, I also collaborate with Prof. Fabio Antonio Stella (UNIMIB), my co-supervisor, and Dr. Alice Bernasconi (Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori) on projects at the intersection of healthcare and Bayesian networks.

Outside of research, Iâ€™m passionate about climbing (though admittedly not very skilled yet!) and maintain a lasting interest in Greek and Latin tragedies and comedies, a legacy of my classical education.
